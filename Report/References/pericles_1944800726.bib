abstract = {In many subduction zones the downdip limit of thrust earthquakes approximately coincides with the intersection of the subduction thrust with the forearc mantle. This limit may be explained by aseismic hydrous minerals present in the mantle wedge. During subduction, fluids released from the subducting slab infiltrate the overlying forearc mantle forming serpentine + brucite, especially in cool subduction zones. At the slab interface itself, talc-rich rocks form in the mantle by the addition of silica transported by rising fluids and by mechanical mixing of mantle and siliceous rocks. In the laboratory, serpentine generally exhibits stable-sliding aseismic behavior. The behavior of talc, a layered hydrous silicate, and brucite, a layered hydroxide, has not been investigated, but their structures also suggest weak stable-sliding behavior. We suggest all three layered hydrous minerals promote aseismic behavior and that their presence controls the downdip limit of thrust earthquakes in many subduction zones.},
