abstract="Neutron diffraction data suitable for Rietveld refinements were collected on a powder sample of synthetic Mg(OH)2 by the Polaris time-of-flight spectrometer (ISIS spallation source, U.K.) at 10-4 7.8(3) and 10.9(6) GPa. The Paris-Edinburgh high-pressure cell with WC anvils was used. Pressure calibration and equation-ofstate results were attained by separate runs with an NaCl internal standard. Interpolation of p(V) data by the fourth-order Birch-Murnaghan e.o.s. yields K0=41(2) GPa, K{\textasciiacutex}0=4(2) and K{\textacutedbl}0=1.1(9) GPa-1. The bulk modulus obtained is smaller than previously reported results. Rietveld refinements (Rprof=1.45{\%} and 2.02{\%} at 10-4 and 10.9 GPa) show that H lies on the threefold axis (1/3, 2/3, z) up to 10.9 GPa, where a model with H disordered in (x, 2x, z) can be refined. In the latter case, a hydrogen bond with O-H=0.902(7), H..O{\textasciiacutex}=2.026(8) {\AA} and <OHO{\textasciiacutex}=145.9 (7){\textdegree} is observed. Differences with previous results for deuterated brucite are discussed. The onset of H disorder, and a jump of the c/a ratio vs. pressure at 6--7 GPa, may be related to a second-order phase transition consistent with recently reported Raman spectroscopic results.",
