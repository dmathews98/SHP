        The abstract is a short, concise explanation of the project
        covering the aims, outlines of techniques used and a short
        summary of the results. It should contain enough information to
        make the aims and success of the project clear, but contain no details.
        A typical abstract should be between 50 and 100 words.

\section{Introduction}

The introduction section of the report should introduce the project in
more detail than in the abstract. In particular it should present the
motivation, the aims, outline of techniques used, and the scope of the project. 
It should also contain references to similar work in the
same field to put your work in the correct context.

As a general rule, people reading the abstract and introduction alone
should have a good idea of the material in the project, the techniques
employed and the results obtained. A typical introduction should be
about 1 page, (300-450 words). 
\section{Background or Theory}

This section should cover the theory of the material in the project
in sufficient detail to make the following work understandable to the
average physicist. It should not contain large sections of standard
bookwork, but should contain references to this material. The exact
contents of this section will depend on the project being undertaken.

This section should contain only the
relevant theory. In particular a life history of the inventor of the
technique to be used is
totally irrelevant\footnote{I have seen a report that contained three pages
on the life of Gabor, and it was not very interesting.}. Here use common sense
and the general rule, ``If in doubt: leave it out'', however
include information that you judge would be useful to one of your
peers if they wehe to repeat the project. If you are
undertaking a 12 week project and it includes a literature search, put the
result of the search here. As a rough guide this section should be
about 3-4 pages for a 6 week project, longer for longer projects.

Note that if the project consists of a series of short experiments
each of which requires a different theory and method, it may be appropriate
to have one {\bf Theory, Method, Results} section for each
experiment.
\section{Method or Strategy}

This section should contain the details of the method employed. 
As in the previous sections standard techniques should not be written
out in detail. For example if you use an oscilloscope to take a
measurement, the theory of the CRO tube\footnote{Don't laugh, I have actually
seen this.} is {\bf not relevant}. In computational projects this
section should be used to explain the algorithms used and the layout of
the computational code. A copy of the acutal code must be
given in the appendices. Long detailed sections of theory, data tables
and details of computational code used in data analysis only should not
appear in this section, but should/may be included in the appendices.

This section should emphasise the philosophy of the approach used
and detail novel techniques. However
please note: this section in {\bf not} a blow-by-blow account of what
you did throughout the project, and in particular it should {\bf not} 
contain large detailed sections about things you tried and found to be
completely wrong. Remember you are writing a technical report, and
not a diary. If however you find that a technique that was expected to
work failed, that is a valid result and should be included.

Here logical structure is particularly important, and you may find that
to maintain good structure you may have to present the experiments
in a different order from the one in which you carried them out.
\section{Results \& Discussion}

This section should detail the obtained results in a clear,
easy-to-follow manner. Remember long tables of numbers are just as boring to
read as they are to type-in. Use graphs to present your results where
-ever practicable. When quoting results or measurements
{\bf DO NOT FORGET ABOUT ERRORS}. Remember there are two basic types
of errors, these being random and systematic, which you must consider.
Remember also the difference between an error and a mistake, computer
program bugs are mistakes.

 
Again be selective in what you include. Half a dozen
tables that contain totally wrong data you collected while you forgot
to switch on the power supply are {\bf not relevant} and will frequently
mask the correct results.

This section must contain a discussion of the results. This should
include a discussion of the experimental and/or numerical errors, and a
comparison with the predictions of the background and theory underlying
the techniques used. This section should highlight particular strengths
and/or weaknesses of the methods used.

 
\section{Conclusion}
This section should summarise the results obtained, detail
conclusions reached, suggest future work, and changes that you would make if you repeated the
experiment. This section should in general be short, 100 to 150 words
being typical for most projects.
\par\noindent
If you have opted to have multiple {\bf Theory, Method, Results}
sections, draw all the results together in a {\bf single} conclusion.
\section{References}

Don't forget this section. Detail the relevant references which
should be cited at the correct place in the text of the report. There
are no fixed rules as to how many references are {\it needed}. Generally
the longer the project, and the more background reading you had to do,
the more references will be required. 

When you cite a reference you must give sufficient information. For
example, for a journal article give, {\it Author}, {\it Title of
article},
{\it Journal Name}, {\it Volumn}, {\it Page}, and {\it Year}, 
while for a book give, {\it Author}, {\it Title},
{\it (Editor if there is one)}, {\it Publisher}, and {\it Year}.        
\appendix
\section{Appendices}

Material that is useful background to the report, but is not essential,
or whose inclusion within the report  would detract from its
structure and readablity, should be included in appendices. Typical
material could be diagrams of electronic circuits built, specialist
data tables used to analyse results, details of computer programs
written for analysis and display of results, photographic plates,
and, for computational projects, a copy of all written code.

Again be selective. The appendix is {\bf not} an excuse for you to add every
last detail and piece of data, but should be used to assist the reader
of the report by supplying additional material. Not all reports require
appendices and if the report is complete without this additional
material leave it out.
